                <h1>NCEA Level One English</h1>     
                    <p>In this achievement standard, you will read a range of written texts that you have not studied before. You will answer several questions
                        on each text to test your understanding of the ideas, style, and language used to communicate the author’s purpose in each text. All questions 
                        will provide the opportunity for achievement, achievement with merit, and achievement with excellence. This is an external standard to be sat 
                        under examination conditions. The paper will consist of short-answer questions based on three texts, including Poetry, and Prose - fiction
                        or non-fiction extracts. You will be given a resources booklet with all texts to be read and a separate 'question and answer' booklet with 
                        lines for you to write on.</p>
