                    <p>The Chance and Data strand focuses on chance events and data-handling processes. In Chance, the focus is on developing your ability to make predictions about how likely an
                        event is in situations where there is uncertainty. In Data, the focus is on collecting, organizing, analyzing, and presenting the information. As a result of your learning,
                        you will be able to use your understanding of likelihood to compare and order everyday chance events and be able to answer questions using data collection and/or interpretation
                        of real-life contexts.</p>

                                <dd>- you may be expected to complete probability trees and use these to find probabilities for any level of achievement</dd>
                                <dd>- multiply probabilities along the branches of tree diagrams if you are asked for the probability that an event AND another event occur</dd>
                                <dd>- add probabilities at the end of the branches if you are asked for the probability that an event OR another event occurs</dd>
                                <dd>- work in a logical order so you donâ€™t leave gaps</dd>   
                                <dd>- attempt to answer every question, even if you are struggling to do so</dd>    
                                <dd>- probabilities are best written as fractions but may be written as a decimal or percentage</dd>    
                                <dd>- if written as a percentage, you must include the percentage sign</dd>    
                                <dd>- probability must not be written as a ratio</dd>
                                <dd>- proofread for missed questions and confusing answers</dd>
                                <dd>- be familiar with outcomes based on using dice, coins, and playing cards</dd>
                                <dd>- read questions carefully and check that you have answered what is asked</dd> 
                                <dd>- if you are asked to justify your reasons, a good way to answer clearly is to clearly bullet point your statements</dd> 
                                <dd>- show all working as credit may be given for a minor slip, if the assessor can see what you have done</dd>
